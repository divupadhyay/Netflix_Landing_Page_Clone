# Netflix_Landing_Page_Clone

Hello there! Step into a world of entertainment with my Netflix landing page clone, meticulously crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here, I present a tribute to the iconic Netflix interface, showcasing my frontend development skills and attention to detail.

Key Features:

Visual Finesse: Experience the sleek and modern design reminiscent of Netflix's signature style. From the hero banner showcasing popular shows to the grid layout of categories, every element is designed to capture the essence of the original.

Responsive Design: Explore a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across devices, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. CSS media queries and flexible grid systems ensure content looks stunning on any screen size.

Interactive Elements: Engage with interactive components powered by JavaScript. From dynamic hover effects on movie thumbnails to modal dialogs for detailed show information, these features enhance user engagement and replicate the Netflix browsing experience.

Content Variety: Discover a curated selection of mock movies and TV shows, organized into genres and categories. Each item includes mock images, titles, and descriptions, demonstrating my ability to create realistic content displays within the Netflix theme.

Accessibility and Usability: Prioritizing accessibility, I've ensured the page meets WCAG standards for text contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. Usability enhancements like smooth scrolling and intuitive navigation enhance the user experience.

Technological Stack: Utilizing modern web development practices, this project incorporates semantic HTML for structure, CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout flexibility, and JavaScript for interactivity. The use of external APIs (mocked in this case) demonstrates my ability to integrate real-time data sources seamlessly.
